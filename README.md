# Image-Driven-Gaming
In the world of gaming, there exists a growing demand for immersive and intuitive control mechanisms.
Traditional input devices, such as keyboards, mice, and controllers, while effective, may not provide the
level of engagement and natural interaction that gamers desire.
This project aims to address this issue by developing a system that allows players to control video games
through image processing. The challenge is to create a reliable and responsive image-based control system that
leverages computer vision technologies to interpret and respond to the gestures, movements, or actions of the
player captured through a camera. The system should be capable of recognizing and translating these visual
cues into in-game actions, offering an innovative and captivating gaming experience that goes beyond
traditional input methods. The project's success will be measured by its ability to provide a seamless and
enjoyable gaming experience while pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction through image
processing.
